# Changelog

Going forward from v0.6.0 (the first new version after the move to https://github.com/Backblaze/blazer), all notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- B2 now applies SSE-B2 (AES256) as the default server-side encryption to every bucket. A nil `BucketAttrs.DefaultServerSideEncryption` passed to `Client.NewBucket` or `Bucket.Update` leaves the default to the server; any other setting than SSE-B2 with AES256 is rejected before the request is sent.
- `base.CreateBucket` takes the bucket's default server-side encryption as an additional argument.

### Fixed

- `base.Bucket.DefaultServerSideEncryption` is decoded from the `{isClientAuthorizedToRead, value}` object B2 returns. It was read as a flat object, so `Bucket.Update` sent an empty encryption mode and failed.

### Deprecated

- `b2.DefaultServerSideEncryption()`, use `b2.SSEB2WithAES256()` instead.

## [0.7.2] - 2025-01-23

### Changed

- Removed unused `bonfire` and `pyre` code, greatly reducing the number of dependencies and the amount of work required to keep them up to date.
- Restructured the repository as a [Go workspace](https://go.dev/ref/mod#workspaces) and moved the sole remaining third-party dependency into `bin/b2keys`.
